.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrscreen\fR/\fBruscreen\fR/\fBrtmux\fR
is a script to use \fBautossh\fR to open up a remote \fBscreen\fR,
\fBscreen -U\fR or \fBtmux\fR session, or reconnect to an existing one.

Based on autossh's original \fBrscreen\fR example script as installed
on Debian systems into \fI/usr/share/doc/autossh/examples/rscreen\fR,
but with more generally usable defaults.

.B ruscreen
and
.B rtmux
are just symbolic links to the
.B rscreen
script and the script checks under which name it has been called.
